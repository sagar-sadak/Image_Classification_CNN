# Image_Classification_CNN
Used a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network to classify hand images of rock, paper, scissors from the tensorflow_dataset. 
Reduced overfitting and increased generalization using Data Augmentation, AveragePooling, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Early Stopping to reach a 
test accuracy score of 92%
